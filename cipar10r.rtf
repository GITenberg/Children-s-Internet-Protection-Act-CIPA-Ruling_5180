ell known, is a vast, interactive medium based on a decentralized network of computers around the world.  Its most familiar feature is the World Wide Web (the \'93Web\'94
), a network of computers known as servers that provide content to users.  The Internet prov
ides easy access to anyone who wishes to provide or distribute information to a worldwide audience; it is used by more than 143 million Americans.  Indeed, much of the world\rquote 
s knowledge accumulated over centuries is available to Internet users almost insta
ntly.  Approximately 10% of the Americans who use the Internet access it at public libraries.  And approximately 95% of all public libraries in the United States provide public access to the Internet.

et in expanding the amount of information  available to its users is self-evident, its low entry barriers have also led to a perverse result \endash 
 facilitation of the widespread dissemination of hardcore pornography within the easy reach not only of adults who
 have every right to access it (so long as it is not legally obscene or child pornography), but also of children and adolescents to whom it may be quite harmful.  The volume of pornography on the Internet is huge, and the record before us demonstrates tha
t
 public library patrons of all ages, many from ages 11 to 15, have regularly sought to access it in public library settings.  There are more than 100,000 pornographic Web sites that can be accessed for free and without providing any registration informati
on, and tens of thousands of Web sites contain child pornography. 
\par Libraries have reacted to this situation by utilizing a number of means designed to insure that patrons avoid illegal (and unwanted) content while also enabling patrons to find the content t
hey desire.  Some libraries have trained patrons in how to use the Internet while avoiding illegal content, or have directed their patrons to \'93preferred\'94
 Web sites that librarians have reviewed.  Other libraries have utilized such devices as recessing the computer monitors, installing privacy screens, and monitoring implemented by a \'93tap on the shoulder\'94
 of patrons perceived to be offending library policy.  Still others, viewing the foregoing approaches as inadequate or uncomfortable (some librarians do not
 wish to confront patrons), have purchased commercially available software that blocks certain categories of material deemed by the library board as unsuitable for use in their facilities.  Indeed, 7% of American public libraries use blocking software for
 adults.  Although such programs are somewhat effective in blocking large quantities of pornography, they are blunt instruments that not only \'93underblock,\'94
 i.e., fail to block access to substantial amounts of content that the library boards wish to exclude, but also, central to this litigation, \'93overblock,\'94
 i.e., block access to large quantities of material that library boards do not wish to exclude and that is constitutionally protected.

Most of the libraries that use filtering software seek to block sexually explicit speech.  While most libraries include in their physical collection copies of volumes such as }{\i\fs26 The Joy of Sex}{\fs26  and }{\i\fs26 The Joy of Gay Sex}{\fs26 
, which contain quite explicit photographs and descriptions, filtering software blocks large quant
ities of other, comparable information about health and sexuality that adults and teenagers seek on the Web.  One teenager testified that the Internet access in a public library was the only venue in which she could obtain information important to her abo
u
t her own sexuality.  Another library patron witness described using the Internet to research breast cancer and reconstructive surgery for his mother who had breast surgery.  Even though some filtering programs contain exceptions for health and education,
 
the exceptions do not solve the problem of  overblocking constitutionally protected material.  Moreover, as we explain below, the filtering software on which the parties presented evidence in this case overblocks not only information relating to health an
d sexuality that might be mistaken for pornography or erotica, but also vast numbers of Web pages and sites that could not even arguably be construed as harmful or inappropriate for adults or minors.

 grants under the Library Services and Technology Act, 20 U.S.C. \'a7 9101 }{\i\fs26 et seq.}{\fs26  (\'93LSTA\'94), and so-called \'93E-rate discounts\'94 for Internet access and support under the Telecommunications Act,}{\b\fs26  }{\fs26 47 U.S.C. \'a7

The plaintiffs, a group of libraries, library associations, library patrons, and Web site publishers, brought this suit against the United States and others alleging that CIPA is facially unconstitutional}{\b\fs26  }{\fs26 
because: (1) it induces public libraries to violate their patrons\rquote  First Amendment rights contrary to the requirements of }{\i\fs26 South Dakota v. Dole}{\fs26 
, 483 U.S. 203 (1987); and (2) it requires libraries to relinquish their First Amendment rights as a cond
ition on the receipt of federal funds and is therefore impermissible under the doctrine of unconstitutional conditions.  In arguing that CIPA will induce public libraries to violate the First Amendment, the plaintiffs contend that given the limits of the 
filtering technology, CIPA\rquote s conditions effectively require libraries to impose content-based restrictions on their patrons\rquote 
 access to constitutionally protected speech.  According to the plaintiffs, these content-based restrictions are subject to strict scrutiny under public forum doctrine, }{\i\fs26 see}{\fs26  }{\i\fs26 Rosenberger v. Rector & Visitors of Univ. of Va.}{
\fs26 , 515 U.S. 819, 837 (1995), and are therefore permissible only if they are narrowly tailored to further a compelling state interest and no less restrictive alternatives would further that interest, }{\i\fs26 see}{\fs26  }{\i\fs26 Reno v. ACLU}{

 Plaintiffs advance three other alternative, independent grounds for holding CIPA facially invalid.  First, they submit that even if CIPA will not induce public libraries to vi
olate the First Amendment, CIPA nonetheless imposes an unconstitutional condition on public libraries by requiring them to relinquish their own First Amendment rights to provide unfiltered Internet access as a condition on their receipt of federal funds. 
 }{\i\fs26 See}{\fs26  }{\i\fs26 infra}{\fs26 \~
n.36.  Second, plaintiffs contend that CIPA is facially invalid because it effects an impermissible prior restraint on speech by granting filtering companies and library staff unfettered discretion to suppress speech before it has been received b
y library patrons and before it has been subject to a judicial determination that it is unprotected under the First Amendment.  }{\i\fs26 See}{\fs26  }{\i\fs26 Southeastern Promotions, Ltd. v. Conrad}{\fs26 
, 420 U.S. 546, 558 (1975).  Finally, plaintiffs submit that CIPA is unconstitutionally vague.  }{\i\fs26 See}{\fs26  }{\i\fs26 City of Chicago v. Morales}{\fs26 , 527 U.S. 41 (1999).}}}{\fs26 
  The government responds that CIPA will not induce public libraries to violate the First Amendment, since it is possible for at least some public libraries to constitutionally comply with CIPA\rquote s conditions.  Even if some libraries\rquote 
 use of filters might violate the First Amendment, the government submits that CIPA can be facially invalidated only if it is impossible for any public library to comply with its conditions without violating the First Amendment.

Pursuant to CIPA, a three-judge Court was convened to try the issues.  Pub. L. No. 106-554}{\i\fs26 .}{\b\fs26   }{\fs26 
Following an intensive period of discovery on an expedited schedule to allow public libraries to know whether they need to certify compl
iance with CIPA by July 1, 2002, to receive subsidies for the upcoming year, the Court conducted an eight-day trial at which we heard 20 witnesses, and received numerous depositions, stipulations and documents.  The principal focus of the trial was on the
 
capacity of currently available filtering software.  The plaintiffs adduced substantial evidence not only that filtering programs bar access to a substantial amount of speech on the Internet that is clearly constitutionally protected for adults and minors
, but also that these programs are intrinsically unable to block only illegal Internet content while simultaneously allowing access to all protected speech. 
\par As our extensive findings of fact reflect, the plaintiffs demonstrated that thousands of Web pages 
containing protected speech are wrongly blocked by the four leading filtering programs, and these pages represent only a fraction of Web pages wrongly blocked by the programs.  The plaintiffs\rquote 
 evidence explained that the problems faced by the manufacturers and vendors of filtering software are legion.  The Web is extremely dynamic, with an estimated 1.5 million new pages added every day}{\b\fs26  }{\fs26 
and the contents of existing Web pages changing very rapidly.  The category lists maintained by the blocking programs are 
considered to be proprietary information, and hence are unavailable to customers or the general public for review, so that public libraries that select categories when implementing filtering software do not really know what they are blocking.

There are many reasons why filtering software suffers from extensive over- and underblocking, which we will explain below in great detail.  They center on the limitations on filtering companies\rquote  ability to: (1) accurately collect Web pages t
hat potentially fall into a blocked category (e.g., pornography); (2) review and categorize Web pages that they have collected; and (3) engage in regular re-review of Web pages that they have previously reviewed.  These failures spring from constraints on
 the technology of automated classification systems, and the limitations inherent in human review, including error, misjudgment, and scarce resources, which we describe in detail }{\i\fs26 infra}{\fs26 
 at 58-74.  One failure of critical importance is that the automated systems that filtering companies use to collect Web pages for classification are able to search only text, not images.  This is crippling to filtering companies\rquote 
 ability to collect pages containing \'93visual depictions\'94 that are obscene, child pornography, or harmful to minors, as CIPA requires.  As will appear, we find that it is currently impossible, given the Internet\rquote 
s size, rate of growth, rate of change, and architecture, and given the state of the art of automated classification systems, to develop a filter that neither underblocks nor overblocks a substantial amount of speech.

The government, while acknowledging that the filtering software is imperfect, maintains that it is nonetheless quite effective, and that it successfully blocks the vast majority of the Web pages that meet filtering companies\rquote 
 category definitions (e.g., pornography).  The government contends that no more is required.  In its view, so long as the filtering software selected by the libraries screens out the bulk of the 
Web pages proscribed by CIPA, the libraries have made a reasonable choice which suffices, under the applicable legal principles, to pass constitutional muster in the context of a facial challenge.  Central to the government\rquote 
s position is the analogy it adv
ances between Internet filtering and the initial decision of a library to determine which materials to purchase for its print collection.  Public libraries have finite budgets and must make choices as to whether to purchase, for example, books on gardenin
g or books on golf.  Such content-based decisions, even the plaintiffs concede, are subject to rational basis review and not a stricter form of First Amendment scrutiny.  In the government\rquote 
s view, the fact that the Internet reverses the acquisition process 
and requires the libraries to, in effect, purchase the entire Internet, some of which (e.g., hardcore pornography) it does not want, should not mean that it is chargeable with censorship when it filters out offending material.
\par The legal context in which this extensive factual record is set is complex, implicating a number of constitutional doctrines, including the constitutional limitations on Congress\rquote 
s spending clause power, the unconstitutional conditions doctrine, and subsidiary to these issues, the First Amendment doctrines of prior restraint, vagueness, and overbreadth.}{\b\fs26   }{\fs26 
There are a number of potential entry points into the analysis, but the most logical is the spending clause jurisprudence in which the seminal case is }{\i\fs26 South Dakota v. Dole}{\fs26 , 483 U.S. 203 (1987).  }{\i\fs26 Dole}{\fs26 
 outlines four categories of constraints on Congress\rquote s exercise of its power under the Spending Clause, but the only }{\i\fs26 Dole}{\fs26 
 condition disputed here is the fourth and last, i.e., whether CIPA requires libraries that receive LSTA funds or E-rate discounts to violate the constitutional rights of their patrons.  As will appear, the question is not a simple one, and turns on the l

The government argues that, in providing Internet access, public libraries do not create a public forum, since public libraries may reserve the right to exclude certain speakers from availing themselves of the forum. 
 Accordingly, the government contends that public libraries\rquote  restrictions on patrons\rquote  Internet access are subject only to rational basis review. 
\par Plaintiffs respond that the government\rquote s ability to restrict speech on its own property, as in the case of res
trictions on Internet access in public libraries, is not unlimited, and that the more widely the state facilitates the dissemination of private speech in a given forum, the more vulnerable the state\rquote 
s decision is to restrict access to speech in that forum.  We agree with the plaintiffs that public libraries\rquote  content-based restrictions on their patrons\rquote 
 Internet access are subject to strict scrutiny.  In providing even filtered Internet access, public libraries create a public forum open to any speaker aroun
d the world to communicate with library patrons via the Internet on a virtually unlimited number of topics.  Where the state provides access to a \'93vast democratic forum[],\'94 }{\i\fs26 Reno v. ACLU}{\fs26 
, 521 U.S. 844, 868 (1997), open to any member of the public to speak on subjects \'93as diverse as human thought,\'94 }{\i\fs26 id.}{\fs26  at 870 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), the state\rquote 
s decision selectively to exclude from the forum speech whose content the state disfavors is subject to strict scrutiny, as such exclusions risk
 distorting the marketplace of ideas that the state has facilitated.  Application of strict scrutiny finds further support in the extent to which public libraries\rquote 
 provision of Internet access uniquely promotes First Amendment values in a manner analogous to traditional public fora such as streets, sidewalks, and parks, in which content-based restrictions are always subject to strict scrutiny.

We are sympathetic to the position of the government, believing that it would be desirable if there were a means to ensure that public library patrons could share in the informational bonanza of the Internet while being insulated from materi
als that meet CIPA\rquote 
s definitions, that is, visual depictions that are obscene, child pornography, or in the case of minors, harmful to minors.  Unfortunately this outcome, devoutly to be wished, is not available in this less than best of all possible world
s.  No category definition used by the blocking programs is identical to the legal definitions of obscenity, child pornography, or material harmful to minors, and, at all events, filtering programs fail to block access to a substantial amount of content o
n the Internet that falls into the categories defined by CIPA.  As will appear, we credit the testimony of plaintiffs\rquote 
 expert Dr. Geoffrey Nunberg that the blocking software is (at least for the foreseeable future) incapable of effectively blocking the majority of materials in the categories defined by CIPA without overblocking a substantial amount of materials.  Nunberg
\rquote s analysis was supported by extensive record evidence.  As noted above, this inability to prevent both substantial amounts of underblocking
 and overblocking stems from several sources, including limitations on the technology that software filtering companies use to gather and review Web pages, limitations on resources for human review of Web pages, and the necessary error that results from h
uman review processes.

Because the filtering software mandated by CIPA will block access to substantial amounts of constitutionally protected speech whose suppression serves no legitimate government interest, we are persuaded that a public library\rquote 
s use of software filters is not narrowly tailored to further any of these interests.  Moreover, less restrictive alternatives exist that further the government\rquote 
s legitimate interest in preventing the dissemination of obscenity, child pornography, an
d material harmful to minors, and in preventing patrons from being unwillingly exposed to patently offensive, sexually explicit content.  To prevent patrons from accessing visual depictions that are obscene and child pornography, public libraries may enfo
rce Internet use policies that make clear to patrons that the library\rquote 
s Internet terminals may not be used to access illegal speech.  Libraries may then impose penalties on patrons who violate these policies, ranging from a warning to notification of law en
forcement, in the appropriate case.  Less restrictive alternatives to filtering that further libraries\rquote 
 interest in preventing minors from exposure to visual depictions that are harmful to minors include requiring parental consent to or presence during unfiltered access, or restricting minors\rquote 
 unfiltered access to terminals within view of library staff.  Finally, optional filtering, privacy screens, recessed monitors, and placement of unfiltered Internet terminals outside of sight-lines provide less restric
tive alternatives for libraries to prevent patrons from being unwillingly exposed to sexually explicit content on the Internet.
\par In an effort to avoid the potentially fatal legal implications of the overblocking problem, the government falls back on the ability of the libraries, under CIPA\rquote s disabling provisions, }{\i\fs26 see}{\fs26  CIPA \'a7 1712 (codified at 20 U.S.C. 
\'a7 9134(f)(3)), CIPA \'a71721(b) (codified at 47 U.S.C. \'a7 254(h)(6)(D)), to unblock a site that is patently proper yet improperly blocked.  The evidence reflects t
hat libraries can and do unblock the filters when a patron so requests.  But it also reflects that requiring library patrons to ask for a Web site to be unblocked will deter many patrons because they are embarrassed, or desire to protect their privacy or 
remain anonymous.  Moreover, the unblocking may take days, and may be unavailable, especially in branch libraries, which are often less well staffed than main libraries.  Accordingly, CIPA\rquote 
s disabling provisions do not cure the constitutional deficiencies in public libraries\rquote  use of Internet filters.

Under these circumstances we are constrained to conclude that the library plaintiffs must prevail in their contention that CIPA requires them to violate the First Amendment rights of their patron
s, and accordingly is facially invalid, even under the standard urged on us by the government, which would permit us to facially invalidate CIPA only if it is impossible for a single public library to comply with CIPA\rquote

The World Wide Web is a part of the Internet that consists of a network of computers, called \'93Web servers,\'94 that host \'93pages\'94 of content accessible via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol or \'93HTTP.\'94
  Anyone with a computer connected to the Internet can search for and retrieve information stored on Web servers located around the world.  Computer users typically access the Web by running a program called a \'93browser\'94
 on their computers.  The browser displays, as individual pages on the computer screen, the various types of content found on the Web and lets the user follow the connections built into Web pages \endash  called \'93hypertext links,\'94 \'93hyperlinks,
\'94 or \'93links\'94 \endash  to additional content.  Two popular browsers are Microsoft Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator. 
\par A \'93Web page\'94 is one or more files a browser graphically assembles to make a viewable whole when a user requests content
 over the Internet.  A Web page may contain a variety of different elements, including text, images, buttons, form fields that the user can fill in, and links to other Web pages.  A \'93Web site\'94
 is a term that can be used in several different ways.  It may r
efer to all of the pages and resources available on a particular Web server.  It may also refer to all the pages and resources associated with a particular organization, company or person, even if these are located on different servers, or in a subdirecto
ry on a single server shared with other, unrelated sites.  Typically, a Web site has as an intended point of entry, a \'93home page,\'94
 which includes links to other pages on the same Web site or to pages on other sites.  Online discussion groups and chat rooms relating to a variety of subjects are available through many Web sites.

Users may find content on the Web using engines that search for requested keywords.  In response to a keyword request, a search engine will display a list of Web sites 
that may contain relevant content and provide links to those sites.  Search engines and directories often return a limited number of sites in their search results (e.g., the Google search engine will return only 2,000 sites in response to a search, even i
f it has found, for example, 530,000 sites in its index that meet the search criteria). 
\par A user may also access content on the Web by typing a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) into the address line of the browser.  A URL is an address that points to some reso
urce located on a Web server that is accessible over the Internet.  This resource may be a Web site, a Web page, an image, a sound or video file, or other resource.  A URL can be either a numeric Internet Protocol or \'93IP\'94
 address, or an alphanumeric \'93domain name\'94 address.  Every Web server connected to the Internet is assigned an IP address.  A typical IP address looks like \'9313.1.64.14.\'94  Typing the URL \'93}{\fs26\ul http://13.1.64.14}{\fs26 /\'94
 into a browser will bring the user to the Web server that corresponds to that address.  For convenience, most Web servers have alphanumeric domain name addresses in addition to IP addresses.  For example, typing in \'93}{\cs21\fs26\ul\cf1 
http://www.paed.uscourts.gov}{\cs21\fs26\cf1 \'94}{\fs26  will bring the user to the same Web server as typing in \'93}{\fs26\ul http://204.170.64.143}{\fs26 .\'94 
\par Every time a user attempts to access material located on a Web server by entering a domain name address into a Web browser, a request is made to a Domain Name Server, which is a directory of domain names and IP addresses, to \'93resolve,\'94
 or translate, the domain name address into an IP address.  That IP address is then used to locate the Web server from which content is being requested.  A Web site may be accessed by using either its domain name address or its IP address.

onsists of several parts.  For example, the alphanumeric URL }{\cs21\fs26\ul\cf1 http://www.paed.uscourts.gov/documents/opinions}{\fs26 
 can be broken down into three parts.  The first part is the transfer protocol the computer will use in accessing the content (e.g., \'93http\'94 for Hype
rtext Transfer Protocol); next is the name of the host server on which the information is stored (e.g., }{\fs26\ul www.paed.uscourts.gov}{\fs26 ); and then the name of the particular file or directory on that server (e.g.,}{\fs26\ul  /documents/opinions}{
\fs26 ).
\par A single Web page may be associated with more than one URL.  For example, the URLs }{\fs26\ul http://www.newyorktimes.com}{\fs26  and }{\fs26\ul http://www.nytimes.com}{\fs26  will both take the user to the }{\i\fs26 New York Times}{\fs26

  The publicly indexable Web is limited to those pages that are accessible by following a link from another Web page that is recognized by a search engine.  This limitation exists because online indexing techniques use
d by popular search engines and directories such as Yahoo, Lycos and AltaVista, are based on \'93spidering\'94

Furthermore, many larger Web sites contain instructions, through software, that prevent spiders from investigating that site, and therefore the contents of such sites also ca
nnot be indexed using spidering technology.  Because of the vast size and decentralized structure of the Web, no search engine or directory indexes all of the content on the publicly indexable Web.  We credit current estimates that no more than 50% of the
 content currently on the publicly indexable Web has been indexed by all search engines and directories combined.  No currently available method or combination of methods for collecting URLs can collect the addresses of all URLs on the Web.
\par The portion of the Web that is not theoretically indexable through the use of \'93spidering\'94 technology, because other Web pages do not link to it, is called the \'93Deep Web.\'94
  Such sites or pages can still be made publicly accessible without being made publicly indexable by, for example, using individual or mass emailings (also known as \'93spam\'94
) to distribute the URL to potential readers or customers, or by using types of Web links that cannot be found by spiders but can be seen and used by readers.  \'93Spamming\'94 is a common meth
od of distributing to potential customers links to sexually explicit content that is not indexable.
\par Because the Web is decentralized, it is impossible to say exactly how large it is.  A 2000 study estimated a total of 7.1 million unique Web sites, which at the Web\rquote 
s historical rate of growth, would have increased to 11 million unique sites as of September 2001.  Estimates of the total number of Web pages vary, but a figure of 2 billion is a reasonable estimate of the number of Web pages that can be reached,
 in theory, by standard search engines.  We need not make a specific finding as to a figure, for by any measure the Web is extremely vast, and it is constantly growing.  The indexable Web is growing at a rate of approximately 1.5 million pages per day.  T
he size of the un-indexable Web, or the \'93Deep Web,\'94 while impossible to determine precisely, is estimated to be two to ten times that of the publicly indexable Web.

American public libraries operate in a wide variety of communities, and it is not surprising that they do not all view their mission identically.  Nor are their practices uniform.  Nevertheless, they generally share a common mission \endash  to pro
vide patrons with a wide range of information and ideas. 
\par Public libraries across the country have endorsed the American Library Association\rquote s (\'93ALA\'94) \'93Library Bill of Rights\'94 and/or \'93Freedom to Read Statement,\'94 including every library testifying on behalf
 of the defendants in this case.  The \'93Library Bill of Rights,\'94 first adopted by the ALA in 1948, provides, among other things, that \'93
[b]ooks and other library resources should be provided for the interest, information, and enlightenment of all people of the community the library serves.\'94  It also states that libraries \'93
should provide materials and information presenting all points of view on current and historical issues\'94 and that library materials \'93should not be proscribed or removed because of partisan or doctrinal disapproval.\'94  
\par The ALA\rquote s \'93Freedom to Read\'94 statement, adopted in 1953 and most recently updated in July 2000, states, among other things, that \'93[i]t is in the public interest for publishers and librarians to make available the widest diversity
 of views and expressions, including those that are unorthodox or unpopular with the majority.\'94  It also states that \'93
[i]t is the responsibility of . . . librarians . . . to contest encroachments upon th[e] freedom [to read] by individuals or groups seeking to impose their own standards or tastes upon the community at large.\'94

Public libraries provide information not only for educational purposes, but also for recreational, professional, and other purposes.  For example, Ginnie Cooper, Director of the Multnomah County Library, testified that some of the library\rquote

mystery novels.  Many public libraries include sexually explicit materials in their print collection, such as }{\i\fs26 The Joy of Sex}{\fs26  and }{\i\fs26 The Joy of Gay Sex}{\fs26

  The OCLC database, a cooperative cataloging service established to facilitate interlibrary loan requests, includes 40 million catalog records from approximately 48,000 libraries of all types worldwide.  Slightly more than

\par The mission of public librarians is to provide their patrons with a wide array of information, and they surely do so. 
 Reference librarians across America answer more than 7 million questions weekly.  If a patron has a specialized need for information not available in the public library, the professional librarian will use a reference interview to find out what informati
on is needed to help the user, including the purpose for which an item will be used.  Reference librarians are trained to assist patrons without judging the patron\rquote 
s purpose in seeking information, or the content of the information that the patron is seeking.

Many public libraries routinely provide patrons with access to materials not in their collections through the use of bibliographic access tools and interlibrary loan programs.  Public libraries typically will assist patrons in obtaining 
access to all materials except those that are illegal, even if they do not collect those materials in their physical collection.  In order to provide this access, a librarian may attempt to find material not included in the library\rquote 
s own collection in other libraries in the system, through interlibrary loan, or through a referral, perhaps to a government agency or a commercial bookstore.  Interlibrary loan is expensive, however, and is therefore used infrequently.  
\par Public librarians also apply professional
 standards to their collection development practices.  Public libraries generally make material selection decisions and frame policies governing collection development at the local level.  Collection development is a key subject in the curricula of Master
s
 of Library Science programs and is defined by certain practices.  In general, professional standards guide public librarians to build, develop and create collections that have certain characteristics, such as balance in its coverage and requisite and app
r
opriate quality.  To this end, the goal of library collections is not universal coverage, but rather to find those materials that would be of the greatest direct benefit or interest to the community.  In making selection decisions, librarians consider cri
teria including the content of the material, its accuracy, the title\rquote s niche in relation to the rest of the collection, the authority of the author, the publisher, the work\rquote 
s presentation, and how it compares with other material available in the same genre or on the same subject.   
\par \sect }\sectd \sbknone\linex0\headery1440\footery1440\sectdefaultcl \pard\plain \ql \fi720\li0\ri0\sl480\slmult1\nowidctlpar\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0 \fs24\lang1033\langfe1033\cgrid\langnp1033\langfenp1033 {\fs26 
In pursuing the goal of achieving a balanced collection that serves the needs and interests of their patrons, librarians generally have a fair amount of autonomy, but may also be guided by a library\rquote 
s collection development policy.  These collection development policies are often drawn up in conjunction with the libraries\rquote 
 governing boards and with representatives from the community, and may be the result of public hearings, discussions and other input.  
\par Although many librarians use selection aids, such as review journals and bibliographies, as a guide to the quality of potential acquisitions, they do not generally delegate their selection decisions to parties outside of the public library or its gove
rning body.  One limited exception is the use of third-party vendors or approval plans to acquire print and video resources.  In such arrangements, third-party vendors provide materials based on the library\rquote 
s description of its collection development crite
ria.  The vendor sends materials to the library, and the library retains the materials that meet its collection development needs and returns the materials that do not.  Even in this arrangement, however, the librarians still retain ultimate control over 
their collection development and review all of the materials that enter their library\rquote s collection.

Public Libraries and the Internet 2000: Summary Findings and Data Tables}{\fs26 
, Report to National Commission on Libraries and Information Science, at 3.  The Internet vastly expands the amount of information available to patrons of public libraries.  The widespread availability o
f Internet access in public libraries is due, in part, to the availability of public funding, including state and local funding and the federal funding programs regulated by CIPA.
\par Many libraries face a large amount of patron demand for their Internet servi
ces.  At some libraries, patron demand for Internet access during a given day exceeds the supply of computer terminals with access to the Internet.  These libraries use sign-in and time limit procedures and/or establish rules regarding the allowable uses 
of the terminals, in an effort to ration their computer resources.  For example, some of the libraries whose librarians testified at trial prohibit the use of email and chat functions on their public Internet terminals. 
\par Public libraries play an important r
ole in providing Internet access to citizens who would not otherwise possess it.  Of the 143 million Americans using the Internet, approximately 10%, or 14.3 million people, access the Internet at a public library.   Internet access at public libraries is
 
more often used by those with lower incomes than those with higher incomes.  About 20.3% of Internet users with household family income of less than $15,000 per year use public libraries for Internet access.  Approximately 70% of libraries serving communi
ties with poverty levels in excess of 40% receive E-rate discounts.

 use of the Internet.  These policies set forth the conditions under which patrons are permitted to access and use the library\rquote s Internet resources.  These policies vary widely.  Some of 
the less restrictive policies, like those held by Multnomah County Library and Fort Vancouver Regional Library, do not prohibit adult patrons from viewing sexually explicit materials on the Web, as long as they do so at terminals with privacy screens or r
ecessed monitors, which are designed to prevent other patrons from seeing the material that they are viewing, and as long as it does not violate state or federal law to do so.  Other libraries prohibit their patrons from viewing all \'93sexually explicit
\'94 or \'93sexually graphic\'94 materials. 
\par Some libraries prohibit the viewing of materials that are not necessarily sexual, such as Web pages that are \'93harmful to minors,\'94 \'93offensive to the public,\'94 \'93objectionable,\'94 \'93racially offensive,\'94 or simply \'93inappropriate.\'94
  Ot
her libraries restrict access to Web sites that the library just does not want to provide, even though the sites are not necessarily offensive.  For example, the Fulton County Public Library restricts access to the Web sites of dating services.  Similarly
, the Tacoma Public Library\rquote s policy does not allow patrons to use the library\rquote s Internet terminals for personal email, for online chat, or for playing games.  
\par In some cases, libraries instituted Internet use policies after having experienced specific prob
lems, whereas in other cases, libraries developed detailed Internet use policies and regulatory measures (such as using filtering software) before ever offering public Internet access.  Essentially four interests motivate libraries to institute Internet u
se policies and to apply the methods described above to regulate their patrons\rquote  use of the Internet.

First, libraries have sought to protect patrons (especially children) and staff members from accidentally viewing sexually explicit images, 
or other Web pages containing content deemed harmful, that other patrons are viewing on the Internet.  For example, some librarians who testified described situations in which patrons left sexually explicit images minimized on an Internet terminal so that
 the next patron would see them when they began using it, or in which patrons printed sexually explicit images from a Web site and left them at a public printer.  
\par Second, libraries have attempted to protect patrons from unwittingly or accidentally accessing Web pages that they do not wish to see while they are using the Internet.  For example, the Memphis-Shelby County (Tennessee) Public Library\rquote 
s Internet use policy states that the library \'93employs filtering technology to reduce the possibility that customers may encounter objectionable content in the form of depictions of full nudity and sexual acts.\'94 
\par \sect }\sectd \sbknone\linex0\headery1440\footery1440\sectdefaultcl \pard\plain \ql \fi720\li0\ri0\sl480\slmult1\nowidctlpar\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0 \fs24\lang1033\langfe1033\cgrid\langnp1033\langfenp1033 {\fs26 
Third, libraries have sought to keep patrons (again, especially children) from intentionally accessing sexually explicit materials or other materials that the library deems inappropriate.  For example, a study of the Tacoma Public Library\rquote 
s Internet use logs for the year 2000 showed that users between the ages of 11 and 15 accounted for 41% of the filter blocks that occurred on library computer
s.  The study, which we credit, concluded that children and young teens were actively seeking to access sexually explicit images in the library.  The Greenville Library\rquote 
s Board of Directors was particularly concerned that patrons were accessing obscene materials in the public library in violation of South Carolina\rquote s obscenity statute. 
\par Finally, some libraries have regulated patrons\rquote  Internet use to attempt to control patrons\rquote  inappropriate (or illegal) behavior that is thought to stem from viewing Web pages
 that contain sexually explicit materials or content that is otherwise deemed unacceptable. 
\par We recognize the concerns that led several of the public libraries whose librarians and board members testified in this case to start using Internet filtering soft
ware.  The testimony of the Chairman of the Board of the Greenville Public Library is illustrative.  In December 1999, there was considerable local press coverage in Greenville concerning adult patrons who routinely used the library to surf the Web for po
rnography.  In response to public outcry stemming from the newspaper report, the Board of Trustees held a special board meeting to obtain information and to communicate with the public concerning the library\rquote 
s provision of Internet access.  At this meeting, the Board learned for the first time of complaints about children being exposed to pornography that was displayed on the library\rquote s Internet terminals. 
\par \sect }\sectd \sbknone\linex0\headery1440\footery1440\sectdefaultcl \pard\plain \ql \fi720\li0\ri0\sl480\slmult1\nowidctlpar\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0 \fs24\lang1033\langfe1033\cgrid\langnp1033\langfenp1033 {\fs26 
In late January to early February of 2000, the library installed privacy screens and rec
essed terminals in an effort to restrict the display of sexually explicit Web sites at the library.  In February, 2000, the Board informed the library staff that they were expected to be familiar with the South Carolina obscenity statute and to enforce th
e policy prohibition on access to obscene materials, child pornography, or other materials prohibited under applicable local, state, and federal laws.  Staff were told that they were to enforce the policy by means of a \'93tap on the shoulder.\'94
  Prior to adopting its current Internet Use Policy, the Board adopted an \'93Addendum to Current Internet Use Policy.\'94
  Under the policy, the Board temporarily instituted a two-hour time limit per day for Internet use; reduced substantially the number of computers with Inte
rnet access in the library; reconfigured the location of the computers so that librarians had visual contact with all Internet-accessible terminals; and removed the privacy screens from terminals with Internet access. 
\par Even after the Board implemented the privacy screens and later the \'93tap-on-the-shoulder\'94
 policy combined with placing terminals in view of librarians, the library experienced a high turnover rate among reference librarians who worked in view of Internet terminals.  Finding that the policies t
hat it had tried did not prevent the viewing of sexually explicit materials in the library, the Board at one point considered discontinuing Internet access in the library.  The Board finally concluded that the methods that it had used to regulate Internet
 use were not sufficient to stem the behavioral problems that it thought were linked to the availability of pornographic materials in the library.  As a result, it implemented a mandatory filtering policy.

The methods that public libraries use to regulate Internet use vary greatly.  They can be organized into four categories: (1) channeling patrons\rquote 
 Internet use; (2) separating patrons so that they will not see what other patrons are viewing; (3) placing Internet terminals in public view and having librarians observe patrons to make sure that they are complying with the library\rquote 
s Internet use policy; and (4) using Internet filtering software.  
\par The first category \endash  channeling patrons\rquote  Internet use \endash  frequentl
y includes offering training to patrons on how to use the Internet, including how to access the information that they want and to avoid the materials that they do not want.  Another technique that some public libraries use to direct their patrons to pages
 that the libraries have determined to be accurate and valuable is to establish links to \'93recommended Web sites\'94 from the public library\rquote s home page (i.e., the page that appears when patrons begin a session at one of the library\rquote 
s public Internet terminals)
.  Librarians select these recommended Web sites by using criteria similar to those employed in traditional collection development.  However, unless the library determines otherwise, selection of these specific sites does not preclude patrons from attempt
ing to access other Internet Web sites.  
\par \sect }\sectd \sbknone\linex0\headery1440\footery1440\sectdefaultcl \pard\plain \ql \fi720\li0\ri0\sl480\slmult1\nowidctlpar\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0 \fs24\lang1033\langfe1033\cgrid\langnp1033\langfenp1033 {\fs26 Libraries may extend the \'93
recommended Web sites\'94 method further by limiting patrons\rquote  access to only those Web sites that are reviewed and selected by the library\rquote s staff.  For example, in 1996, the We
sterville, Ohio Library offered Internet access to children through a service called the \'93Library Channel.\'94
  This service was intended to be a means by which the library could organize the Internet in some fashion for presentation to patrons.  Through the Library Channel, the computers in the children\rquote 
s section of the library were restricted to 2,000 to 3,000 sites selected by librarians.  After three years, Westerville stopped using the Library Channel system because it overly constrained the children\rquote s ab
ility to access materials on the Internet, and because the library experienced several technical problems with the system.

Public libraries also use several different techniques to separate patrons during Internet sessions so that they will not see what other patrons are viewing.  The simplest way to achieve this result is to position the library\rquote 
s public Internet terminals so that they are located away from traffic patterns in the library (and from other terminals), for example, by placing them so that they face a wall.  This method is obviously constrained by libraries\rquote 
 space limitations and physical layout.  Some libraries have also installed privacy screens on their public Internet terminals.  These screens make a monitor appear blank unless the viewer is looking at it head-on.}{\cs15\fs26\super \chftn {\footnote

  Fort Vancouver Regional Library, for example, combines the methods of strategically placing terminals in low traffic areas and using privacy screens.  A section headed \'93Confidentiality and Privacy\'94 on the library\rquote s home page states: \'93
in order to protect the privacy of the user and the interests of other library patrons, the library will attempt to minimize unintentional viewing of the Internet.  This will be done by use of privacy screens, and by judicious pla
cement of the terminals and other appropriate means.\'94}}}{\fs26   Although the Multnomah and Fort Vancouver Libraries submitted records showing that they have received few complaints regarding patrons\rquote 
 unwilling exposure to materials on the Internet, privacy screens
 do not always prevent library patrons or employees from inadvertently seeing the materials that another patron is viewing when passing directly behind a terminal.  They also have the drawback of making it difficult for patrons to work together at a singl
e
 terminal, or for librarians to assist patrons at terminals, because it is difficult for two people to stand side by side and view a screen at the same time.  Some library patrons also find privacy screens to be a hindrance and have attempted to remove th
em in order to improve the brightness of the screen or to make the view better.  
\par \sect }\sectd \sbknone\linex0\headery1440\footery1440\sectdefaultcl \pard\plain \ql \fi720\li0\ri0\sl480\slmult1\nowidctlpar\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0 \fs24\lang1033\langfe1033\cgrid\langnp1033\langfenp1033 {\fs26 
Another method that libraries use to prevent patrons from seeing what other patrons are viewing on their terminals is the installation of \'93recessed monitors.\'94  
Recessed monitors are computer screens that sit below the level of a desk top and are viewed from above.  Although recessed monitors, especially when combined with privacy screens, eliminate almost all of the possibility of a patron accidentally viewing t
he contents on another patron\rquote 
s screen, they suffer from the same drawbacks as privacy screens, that is, they make it difficult for patrons to work together or with a librarian at a single terminal.  Some librarians also testified that recessed monitors are
 costly, but did not indicate how expensive they are compared to privacy screens or filtering software.  A related technique that some public libraries use is to create a separate children\rquote 
s Internet viewing area, where no adults except those accompanying 
children in their care may use the Internet terminals.  This serves the objective of keeping children from inadvertently viewing materials appropriate only for adults that adults may be viewing on nearby terminals. 
\par A third set of techniques that public libraries have used to enforce their Internet use policies takes the opposite tack from the privacy screens/recessed monitors approach by placing all of the library\rquote 
s public Internet terminals in prominent and visible locations, such as near the library\rquote s reference desk.  This approach allows librarians to enforce their library\rquote 
s Internet use policy by observing what patrons are viewing and employing the tap-on-the-shoulder policy.  Under this approach, when patrons are viewing materials that are inconsistent with the library\rquote 
s policies, a library staff member approaches them and asks them to view something else, or may ask them to end their Internet session.  A patron who does not comply with these requests, or who repeatedly views materials not permitted under the library
\rquote s Internet use policy, may have his or her Internet or library privileges suspended or revoked.  But many librarians are uncomfortable with approaching patrons who are viewing sexually explicit images, finding confrontation unpleasant.  Henc
e some libraries are reluctant to apply the tap-on-the-shoulder policy.

The fourth category of methods that public libraries employ to enforce their Internet use policies, and the one that gives rise to this case, is the use of Internet filtering software.  According to the June 2000 }{\i\fs26 
Survey of Internet Access Management in Public Libraries}{\fs26 , approximately 7% of libraries with public Internet access had mandated the use of blocking programs by adult patrons.  Some public libraries provide pat
rons with the option of using a blocking program, allowing patrons to decide whether to engage the program when they or their children access the Internet.  Other public libraries require their child patrons to use filtering software, but not their adult 
patrons.  
\par Filtering software vendors sell their products on a subscription basis.  The cost of a subscription varies with the number of computers on which the filtering software will be used.  In 2001, the cost of the Cyber Patrol filtering software was $1
,950 for 100 terminal licenses.  The Greenville County Library System pays $2,500 per year for the N2H2 filtering software, and a subscription to the Websense filter costs Westerville Public Library approximately $1,200 per year. 
\par No evidence was presented
 on the cost of privacy screens, recessed monitors, and the tap-on-the-shoulder policy, relative to the costs of filtering software.  Nor did any of the libraries proffered by the government present any quantitative evidence on the relative effectiveness 
o
f use of privacy screens to prevent patrons from being unwillingly exposed to sexually explicit material, and the use of filters, discussed below.  No evidence was presented, for example, comparing the number of patron complaints in those libraries that h
ave tried both methods.

The librarians who testified at trial whose libraries use Internet filtering software all provide methods by which their patrons may ask the library to unblock specific Web sites or pages.  Of these, only the
 Tacoma Public Library allows patrons to request that a URL be unblocked without providing any identifying information; Tacoma allows patrons to request a URL by sending an email from the Internet terminal that the patron is using that does not contain a 
return email address for the user.  David Biek, the head librarian at the Tacoma Library\rquote 
s main branch, testified at trial that the library keeps records that would enable it to know which patrons made unblocking requests, but does not use that information 
to connect users with their requests.  Biek also testified that he periodically scans the library\rquote 
s Internet use logs to search for: (1) URLs that were erroneously blocked, so that he may unblock them; or (2) URLs that should have been blocked, but were no
t, in order to add them to a blocked category list.  In the course of scanning the use logs,  Biek has also found what looked like attempts to access child pornography.  In two cases, he communicated his findings to law enforcement and turned over the log
s in response to a subpoena.  
\par At all events, it takes time for librarians to make decisions about whether to honor patrons\rquote  requests to unblock Web pages.  In the libraries proffered by the defendants, unblocking decisions sometimes take between 24 hours a
nd a week.  Moreover, none of these libraries allows unrestricted access to the Internet pending a determination of the validity of a Web site blocked by the blocking programs.  A few of the defendants\rquote 
 proffered libraries represented that individual libra
rians would have the discretion to allow a patron to have full Internet access on a staff computer upon request, but none claimed that allowing such access was mandatory, and patron access is supervised in every instance.  None of these libraries makes di
fferential unblocking decisions based on the patrons\rquote  age.  Unblocking decisions are usually made identically for adults and minors.  Unblocking decisions even for adults are usually based on suitability of the Web site for minors.

parent that many patrons are reluctant or unwilling to ask librarians to unblock Web pages or sites that contain only materials that might be deemed personal or embarrassing, even if they are not sexually explicit or pornographic.  We credit the testimony
 
of Emmalyn Rood, discussed above, that she would have been unwilling as a young teen to ask a librarian to disable filtering software so that she could view materials concerning gay and lesbian issues.  We also credit the testimony of Mark Brown, who stat
ed that he would have been too embarrassed to ask a librarian to disable filtering software if it had impeded his ability to research treatments and cosmetic surgery options for his mother when she was diagnosed with breast cancer.  
\par The pattern of patron requests to unblock specific URLs in the various libraries involved in this case also confirms our finding that patrons are largely unwilling to make unblocking requests unless they are permitted to do so anonymously.  For example, t
h
e Fulton County Library receives only about 6 unblocking requests each year, the Greenville Public Library has received only 28 unblocking requests since August 21, 2000, and the Westerville, Ohio Library has received fewer than 10 unblocking requests sin
ce 1999.  In light of the fact that a substantial amount of overblocking occurs in these very libraries, }{\i\fs26 see infra }{\fs26 
Subsection II.E.4, we find that the lack of unblocking requests in these libraries does not reflect the effectiveness of the filters, but rather reflects patrons\rquote  reluctance to ask librarians to unblock sites.

\par When compiling and categorizing URLs for their category lists, filtering software companies go through two distinct phases.  First, they must collect or \'93harvest\'94 the
 relevant URLs from the vast number of sites that exist on the Web.  Second, they must sort through the URLs they have collected to determine under which of the company\rquote

 result in a tradeoff between overblocking (i.e., the blocking of content that does not meet the category definitions established by CIPA or by the filtering software companies), and underblocking (i.e., leaving off of a control list a URL that contains c
ontent that would meet the category definitions defined by CIPA or the filtering software companies).

index or classify all of the billions of pages that exist on the Web.  Instead, the set of pages that they attempt to examine and classify is restricted to a small portion of the Web.  The companies use a variety of automated and manual methods to identif
y a universe of Web sites and pages to \'93harvest\'94
 for classification.  These methods include: entering certain key words into search engines; following links from a variety of online directories (e.g., generalized directories like Yahoo or various specialize

ing certain keywords into commercial search engines, suffers from several limitations.  First, the Web pages that may be \'93harvested\'94
 through this method are limited to those pages that search engines have already identified.  However, as noted above, a sub
stantial portion of the Web is not even theoretically indexable (because it is not linked to by any previously known page), and only approximately 50% of the pages that are theoretically indexable have actually been indexed by search engines.  We are sati
sfied that the remainder of the indexable Web, and the vast \'93Deep Web,\'94 which cannot currently be indexed, includes materials that meet CIPA\rquote 
s categories of visual depictions that are obscene, child pornography, and harmful to minors.  These portions of the
 Web cannot presently be harvested through the methods that filtering software companies use (except through reporting by customers or by observing users\rquote 
 log files), because they are not linked to other known pages.  A user can, however, gain access to a Web site in the unindexed Web or the Deep Web if the Web site\rquote s proprietor or some other third party informs the user of the site\rquote 
s URL.  Some Web sites, for example, send out mass email advertisements containing the site\rquote s URL, the spamming process we have described above.   
\par Second, the search engines that software companies use for harvesting are able to search text only, not images.  }{\b\f29\fs26 This is of critical importance, because CIPA, by its own terms, covers only \'93visual depictions.\'94  20 U.S.C. \'a7
 9134(f)(1)(A)(i); 47 U.S.C. \'a7
 254(h)(5)(B)(i).  Image recognition technology is immature, ineffective, and unlikely to improve substantially in the near future.  None of the filtering software companies deposed in this case employs image recognition technology when h
arvesting or categorizing URLs.  Due to the reliance on automated text analysis and the absence of image recognition technology, a Web page with sexually explicit images and no text cannot be harvested using a search engine.  This problem is complicated b
y
 the fact that Web site publishers may use image files rather than text to represent words, i.e., they may use a file that computers understand to be a picture, like a photograph of a printed word, rather than regular text, making automated review of thei
r textual content impossible.  For example, if the Playboy Web site displays its name using a logo rather than regular text, a search engine would not see or recognize the Playboy name in that logo.  }{\fs26

arch engines and Web directories (particularly those specializing in sexually explicit sites or other categories relevant to one of the filtering companies\rquote 
 category definitions), and by mining user logs and collecting URLs submitted by users, the filtering companies expand their list of harvested URLs by using \'93spidering\'94 software that can \'93crawl\'94
 the lists of pages produced by the previous four methods, following their links downward to bring back the pages to which they link (and the pages to which those
 pages link, and so on, but usually down only a few levels).  This spidering software uses the same type of technology that commercial Web search engines use.  
\par While useful in expanding the number of relevant URLs, the ability to retrieve additional pages
 through this approach is limited by the architectural feature of the Web that page-to-page links tend to converge rather than diverge.  That means that the more pages from which one spiders downward through links, the smaller the proportion of new sites 
o
ne will uncover; if spidering the links of 1000 sites retrieved through a search engine or Web directory turns up 500 additional distinct adult sites, spidering an additional 1000 sites may turn up, for example, only 250 additional distinct sites, and the
 proportion of new sites uncovered will continue to diminish as more pages are spidered.  
\par These limitations on the technology used to harvest a set of URLs for review will necessarily lead to substantial underblocking of material with respect to both the category definitions employed by filtering software companies and CIPA\rquote

  All of the filtering companies deposed in the case also employ human review of some or all collected Web pages at some point during the process of categorizing Web pages.  As with the harvesting process,
 each technique employed in the winnowing process is subject to limitations that can result in both overblocking and underblocking.

First, simple key-word-based filters are subject to the obvious limitation that no string of words can iden
tify all sites that contain sexually explicit content, and most strings of words are likely to appear in Web sites that are not properly classified as containing sexually explicit content.  As noted above, filtering software companies also use more sophis
t
icated automated classification systems for the statistical classification of texts.  These systems assign weights to words or other textual features and use algorithms to determine whether a text belongs to a certain category.  These algorithms sometimes
 make reference to the position of a word within a text or its relative proximity to other words.  The weights are usually determined by machine learning methods (often described as \'93artificial intelligence\'94
).  In this procedure, which resembles an automated form of trial and error, a system is given a \'93training set\'94
 consisting of documents preclassified into two or more groups, along with a set of features that might be potentially useful in classifying the sets.  The system then \'93learns\'94 rules that assign 
weights to those features according to how well they work in classification, and assigns each new document to a category with a certain probability.  
\par }{\b\f29\fs26 Notwithstanding their \'93artificial intelligence\'94 description, automated text classification systems are un
able to grasp many distinctions between types of content that would be obvious to a human.  And of critical importance, no presently conceivable technology can make the judgments necessary to determine whether a visual depiction fits the legal definitions
 of obscenity, child pornography, or harmful to minors.  }{\fs26 
\par Finally, all the filtering software companies deposed in this case use some form of human review in their process of winnowing and categorizing Web pages, although one company admitted to categorizing some Web pages without any human review}{.  }{\fs26 
SmartFilter states that \'93the final categorization of every Web site is done by a human reviewer.\'94  Another filtering company asserts that of the 10,000 to 30,000 Web pages that enter the \'93work queue\'94 to be catego
rized each day, two to three percent of those are automatically categorized by their PornByRef system (which only applies to materials classified in the pornography category), and the remainder are categorized by human review.   SurfControl also states th
at no URL is ever added to its database without human review.

Human review of Web pages has the advantage of allowing more nuanced, if not more accurate, interpretations than automated classification systems are capable of making, but suffers from its own sources of error.  }{\b\f29\fs26 
The filtering software companies involved here have limited staff, of between eight and a few dozen people, available for hand reviewing Web pages.  The reviewers that are employed by these companies base their categoriza
tion decisions on both the text and the visual depictions that appear on the sites or pages they are assigned to review.  Human reviewers generally focus on English language Web sites, and are generally not required to be multi-lingual.  
\par Given the speed a
t which human reviewers must work to keep up with even a fraction of the approximately 1.5 million pages added to the publicly indexable Web each day, human error is inevitable.  Errors are likely to result from boredom or lack of attentiveness, overzealo
usness, or a desire to \'93err on the side of caution\'94 by screening out material that might be offensive to some customers, even if it does not fit within any of the company\rquote 
s category definitions.  None of the filtering companies trains its reviewers in the l
egal definitions concerning what is obscene, child pornography, or harmful to minors, and none instructs reviewers to take community standards into account when making categorization decisions.

Perhaps because of limitations on the number of human reviewers and because of the large number of new pages that are added to the Web every day, filtering companies also widely engage in the practice of categorizing entire Web sites at the \'93root URL,
\'94 rat
her than engaging in a more fine-grained analysis of the individual pages within a Web site.  For example, the filtering software companies deposed in this case all categorize the entire Playboy Web site as Adult, Sexually Explicit, or Pornography.  They 
do not differentiate between pages within the site containing sexually explicit images or text, and for example, pages containing no sexually explicit content, such as the text of interviews of celebrities or politicians.  If the \'93root\'94 or \'93
top-level\'94 URL of a Web site is given a category tag, then access to all content on that Web site will be blocked if the assigned category is enabled by a customer.  
\par In some cases, whole Web sites are blocked because the filtering companies focus only on the content of t
he home page that is accessed by entering the root URL.  Entire Web sites containing multiple Web pages are commonly categorized without human review of each individual page on that site.  Web sites that may contain multiple Web pages and that require aut
hentication or payment for access are commonly categorized based solely on a human reviewer\rquote s evaluation of the pages that may be viewed prior to reaching the authentication or payment page.

Because there may be hundreds or thousands of pag
es under a root URL, filtering companies make it their primary mission to categorize the root URL, and categorize subsidiary pages if the need arises or if there is time.  This form of overblocking is called \'93inheritance,\'94
 because lower-level pages inherit the categorization of the root URL without regard to their specific content.  In some cases, \'93reverse inheritance\'94
 also occurs, i.e., parent sites inherit the classification of pages in a lower level of the site.  This might happen when pages with sexual content appear in a Web site that is devoted primarily to non-sexual content.  For example, N2H2\rquote 
s Bess filtering product classifies every page in the Salon.com Web site, which contains a wide range of news and cultural commentary, as \'93Sex, Profanity,\'94 based on the fact that the site includes a regular column that deals with sexual issues.

\par Blocking by both domain name and IP address is another practice in which filtering companies engage that is a function both of the architecture of the Web and of the exigencies of dealing with the rapidly expanding number of Web pages.  }{\fs26 
The category lists maintained by filtering software companies can include URLs in either their human-readable domain name address form, their numeric IP address form, or both. }{\b\f29\fs26  Through \'93virtual hosting\'94
 services, hundreds of thousands of Web sites with distinct domain names may share a single numeric IP address.  To the extent that filtering companies block the IP addresses of virtual hosting services, they will necessarily block a substanti
al amount of content without reviewing it, and will likely overblock a substantial amount of content.

Another technique that filtering companies use in order to deal with a structural feature of the Internet is blocking the root level URLs of so-called \'93loophole\'94
 Web sites.  These are Web sites that provide access to a particular Web page, but display in the user\rquote s browser a URL that is different from the URL with which the particular page is usually associated.  Because of this feature, they provide a 
\'93loophole\'94 that can be used to get around filtering software, i.e., they display a URL that is different from the one that appears on the filtering company\rquote s control list.  \'93Loophole\'94
 Web sites include caches of Web pages that have been removed from their original location, \'93anonymizer\'94 sites, and translation sites.  }{\fs26 
\par Caches are archived copies that some search engines, such as Google, keep of the Web pages they index.  The cached copy stored by Google will have a URL that is different from the
 original URL.  Because Web sites often change rapidly, caches are the only way to access pages that have been taken down, revised, or have changed their URLs for some reason.  For example, a magazine might place its current stories under a given URL, and
 replace them monthly with new stories.  If a user wanted to find an article published six months ago, he or she would be unable to access it if not for Google\rquote s cached version.

Some sites on the Web serve as a proxy or intermediary between a user and another Web page.  When using a proxy server, a user does not access the page from its original URL, but rather from the URL of the proxy server.  One type of proxy service is an 
\'93anonymizer.\'94  Users may access Web sites indirectly via an anonymizer when they do not want the Web site they are visiting to be able to determine the IP address from which they are accessing the site, or to leave \'93cookies\'94 on their browser.}

\fs24\lang1033\langfe1033\cgrid\langnp1033\langfenp1033 {\fs26 There is an inherent tradeoff between any filter\rquote s rate of overblocking (which information scientists also call \'93precision\'94) and its rate of underblocking (which is also referr
ed to as \'93recall\'94).  The rate of overblocking or precision is measured by the proportion of the things a classification system assigns to a certain category that are appropriately classified.  The plaintiffs\rquote 
 expert, Dr. Nunberg, provided the hypothetical 
example of a classification system that is asked to pick out pictures of dogs from a database consisting of 1000 pictures of animals, of which 80 were actually dogs.  If it returned 100 hits, of which 80 were in fact pictures of dogs, and the remaining 20
 were pictures of cats, horses, and deer, we would say that the system identified dog pictures with a precision of 80%.  This would be analogous to a filter that overblocked at a rate of 20%.  
\par The recall measure involves determining what proportion of the 
actual members of a category the classification system has been able to identify.  For example, if the hypothetical animal-picture database contained a total of 200 pictures of dogs, and the system identified 80 of them and failed to identify 120, it woul
d have performed with a recall of 40%.  This would be analogous to a filter that underblocked 60% of the material in a category.  
\par In automated classification systems, there is always a tradeoff between precision and recall.  In the animal-picture example, 
the recall could be improved by using a looser set of criteria to identify the dog pictures in the set, such as any animal with four legs, and all the dogs would be identified, but cats and other animals would also be included, with a resulting loss of pr
ecision.  The same tradeoff exists between rates of overblocking and underblocking in filtering systems that use automated classification systems.  For example, an automated system that classifies any Web page that contains the word \'93sex\'94
 as sexually explicit will underblock much less, but overblock much more, than a system that classifies any Web page containing the phrase \'93free pictures of people having sex\'94 as sexually explicit.

This tradeoff between overblocking and underblocking also applies not just to automated classification systems, but also to filters that use only human review.  Given the approximately two billion pages that exist on the Web, the 1.5 million new pages tha
t
 are added daily, and the rate at which content on existing pages changes, if a filtering company blocks only those Web pages that have been reviewed by humans, it will be impossible, as a practical matter, to avoid vast amounts of underblocking.  Techniq
ues used by human reviewers such as blocking at the IP address level, domain name level, or directory level reduce the rates of underblocking, but necessarily increase the rates of overblocking, as discussed above. 
\par To use a simple example, it would be easy
 to design a filter intended to block sexually explicit speech that completely avoids overblocking.  Such a filter would have only a single sexually explicit Web site on its control list, which could be re-reviewed daily to ensure that its content does no
t
 change.  While there would be no overblocking problem with such a filter, such a filter would have a severe underblocking problem, as it would fail to block all the sexually explicit speech on the Web other than the one site on its control list.  Similar
l
y, it would also be easy to design a filter intended to block sexually explicit speech that completely avoids underblocking.  Such a filter would operate by permitting users to view only a single Web site, e.g., the Sesame Street Web site.  While there wo
uld be no underblocking problem with such a filter, it would have a severe overblocking problem, as it would block access to millions of non-sexually explicit sites on the Web other than the Sesame Street site.

The two other studies, one by David Biek, head librarian at the Tacoma Public Library\rquote s main branch, and one by Cory Finnell 
of Certus Consulting Group, of Seattle, Washington, chose actual logs of Web pages visited by library patrons during specific time periods as the universe of Web pages to analyze.  This method, while surely not as accurate as a truly random sample of the

ndexed Web would be (assuming it would be possible to take such a sample), has the virtue of using the actual Web sites that library patrons visited during a specific period.  Because library patrons selected the universe of Web sites that Biek and Finnel
l\rquote s studies analyzed, this removes the possibility of bias resulting from the study author\rquote 
s selection of the universe of sites to be reviewed.  We find that the Lemmons and Hunter studies are of little probative value because of the methodology used to sel
ect the sample universe of Web sites to be tested.  We will therefore focus on the studies conducted by Finnell and Biek in trying to ascertain estimates of the rates of over- and underblocking that takes place when filters are used in public libraries.  

\par The government hired expert witness Cory Finnell to study the Internet logs compiled by the public libraries systems in Tacoma, Washington; Westerville, Ohio; and Greenville, South Carolina.}{  }{\fs26 
Each of these libraries uses filtering software that keeps a log
 of information about individual Web site requests made by library patrons.  Finnell, whose consulting firm specializes in data analysis, has substantial experience evaluating Internet access logs generated on networked systems.  He spent more than a year
 developing a reporting tool for N2H2, and, in the course of that work, acquired a familiarity with the design and operation of Internet filtering products.

The Tacoma library uses Cyber Patrol filtering software, and logs information only o

n
-blocked sites.  When the logs reach a certain size, they are overwritten by new usage logs.  Because of this overwriting feature, logs were available to Finnell only for the relatively short period from October 1, 2001 to October 3, 2001.  The Greenville
 library uses N2H2\rquote 
s filtering product and logs both blocked sites and sites that patrons accessed.  The logs contain more than 500,000 records per day.  Because of the volume of the records, Finnell restricted his analysis to the period from August 2, 2001
 to August 15, 2001.

Finnell calculated an overblocking rate for each of the three libraries by examining the host Web site containing each of the blocked pages.  He did not employ a sampling technique, but instead examined each blocked We
b site.  If the contents of a host Web site or the pages within the Web site were consistent with the filtering product\rquote 
s definition of the category under which the site was blocked, Finnell considered it to be an accurate block.  Finnell and three others,
 two of whom were temporary employees, examined the Web sites to determine whether they were consistent with the filtering companies\rquote 
 category definitions.  Their review was, of course, necessarily limited by: (1) the clarity of the filtering companies\rquote  category definitions; (2) Finnell\rquote s and his employees\rquote 
 interpretations of the definitions; and (3) human error.  The study\rquote s reliability is also undercut by the fact that Finnell failed to archive the blocked Web pages as they existed either at the point tha
t a patron in one of the three libraries was denied access or when Finnell and his team reviewed the pages.  It is therefore impossible for anyone to check the accuracy and consistency of Finnell\rquote 
s review team, or to know whether the pages contained the same content when the block occurred as they did when Finnell\rquote 
s team reviewed them.  This is a key flaw, because the results of the study depend on individual determinations as to overblocking and underblocking, in which Finnell and his team were required to
 compare what they saw on the Web pages that they reviewed with standard definitions provided by the filtering company.

thodology was materially flawed in that it understates the rate of overblocking for the following reasons.  First, patrons from the three libraries knew that the filters were operating, and may have been deterred from attempting to access Web sites that t

 category definitions.  Second, in their cross-examination of Finnell, the plaintiffs offered screen shots of a num
ber of Web sites that, according to Finnell, had been appropriately blocked, but that Finnell admitted contained only benign materials.  Finnell\rquote 
s explanation was that the Web sites must have changed between the time when he conducted the study and the tim
e of the trial, but because he did not archive the images as they existed when his team reviewed them for the study, there is no way to verify this.  Third, because of the way in which Finnell counted blocked Web sites \endash 
 i.e., if separate patrons attempted to reach the same Web site, or one or more patrons attempted to access more than one page on a single Web site, Finnell counted these attempts as a single block, }{\i\fs26 see supra }{\fs26 note 10 \endash

At all events, there is no doubt that Finnell\rquote s estimated rates of overblocking, which are based on the filtering companies\rquote  own category definitions, significantly understate the rate of overblocking with respect to CIPA\rquote 
s category definitions for filtering for adults.  The filters used in the Tacoma, Westerville, and Greenville libraries were configured to block, among other things, images of full nudity and sexually explicit materials.  There is 
no dispute, however, that these categories are far broader than CIPA\rquote s categories of visual depictions that are obscene, or child pornography, the two categories of material that libraries subject to CIPA must certify that they filter during adults

\par Finnell\rquote s study also calculated underblocking rates with respect to the Westerville and Greenville Libraries (both of which logged not only thei

should have been blocked.  This made the denominator that Finnell used much larger than it would have been had he used the standard method for calculating recall, consequently making the underblocking rate that he calculated much lower than it would have

 and suppose that the filter incorrectly failed to block 2 of the 10 sites that it should have blocked and did not block any sites that should not have been blocked.  The standard method of quantifying the rate of underblocking would divide the number of 
sites in the sample that the filter incorrectly failed to block by the number of sites in the sample that the filter should have blocked, yielding an underblocking rate in this example of 20%.  Finnell\rquote

It is difficult to determine how reliable Biek\rquote s conclusions are, because he did not keep records of the raw data that he used in his study; nor did he archive images of the Web pages as they looked when he ma
de the determination whether they were properly classified by the Cyber Patrol program.  Without this information, it is impossible to verify his conclusions (or to undermine them).  And Biek\rquote s study certainly understates Cyber Patrol\rquote 
s overblocking rate for some of the same reasons that Finnell\rquote s study likely understates the true rates of overblocking used in the libraries that he studied. 
\par We also note that Finnell\rquote s study, which analyzed a set of Internet logs from the Tacoma Library during which the sam
e filtering program was operating with the same set of blocking categories enabled, found a significantly higher rate of overblocking than the Biek study did.  Biek found a rate of overblocking of approximately 2% while the Finnell study estimated a 6.34%
 rate of overblocking.  At all events, the category definitions employed by CIPA, at least with respect to adult use \endash  visual depictions that are obscene or child pornography \endash 
 are narrower than the materials prohibited by the Tacoma Library policy, and therefore Biek\rquote s study understates the rate of overblocking with respect to CIPA\rquote s definitions for adults.  
\par In sum, we think that Finnell\rquote s study, while we do not credit its estimates of underblocking, is useful because it states lower bounds with respect to
 the rates of overblocking that occurred when the Cyber Patrol, Websense, and N2H2 filters were operating in public libraries.  While these rates are substantial \endash  between nearly 6% and 15% \endash 
 we think, for the reasons stated above, that they greatly unders
tate the actual rates of overblocking that occurs, and therefore cannot be considered as anything more than minimum estimates of the rates of overblocking that happens in all filtering programs.

 had unblocked most of the pages on the list of 6,777 after he had published the list on his Web site.  His records indicate that an employee of SurfControl (the company that produces Cyber Patrol software) accessed his site and presumably checked out the

Web pages relating to religion, politics and government, health, careers, education, travel, sports, and many other topics.  In the next section, we provide examples from each of these categories.

Public libraries have adopted a variety of means of dealing with problems created by the provision of Internet access.  The large amount of sexually explicit speech
 that is freely available on the Internet has, to varying degrees, led to patron complaints about such matters as unsought exposure to offensive material, incidents of staff and patron harassment by individuals viewing sexually explicit content on the Int
ernet, and the use of library computers to access illegal material, such as child pornography.  In some libraries, youthful library patrons have persistently attempted to use the Internet to access hardcore pornography.

 that have responded to these problems by using software filters have found such filters to provide a relatively effective means of preventing patrons from accessing sexually explicit material on the Internet.  Nonetheless, out of the entire universe of s
peech on the Internet falling within the filtering products\rquote 
 category definitions, the filters will incorrectly fail to block a substantial amount of speech.  Thus, software filters have not completely eliminated the problems that public libraries have soug
ht to address by using the filters, as evidenced by frequent instances of underblocking.  Nor is there any quantitative evidence of the relative effectiveness of filters and the alternatives to filters that are also intended to prevent patrons from access
ing illegal content on the Internet.  
\par Even more importantly (for this case), although software filters provide a relatively cheap and effective, albeit imperfect, means for public libraries to prevent patrons from accessing speech that falls within the filters\rquote 
 category definitions, we find that commercially available filtering programs erroneously block a huge amount of speech that is protected by the First Amendment.  Any currently available filtering product that is reasonably effective in preventing use
rs from accessing content within the filter\rquote s category definitions will necessarily block countless thousands of Web pages, the content of which does not match the filtering company\rquote 
s category definitions, much less the legal definitions of obscenity, chil
d pornography, or harmful to minors.  Even Finnell, an expert witness for the defendants, found that between 6% and 15% of the blocked Web sites in the public libraries that he analyzed did not contain content that meets even the filtering products
\rquote  own definitions of sexually explicit content, let alone CIPA\rquote s definitions.

This phenomenon occurs for a number of reasons explicated in the more detailed findings of fact }{\i\fs26 supra}{\fs26 .  These include limitations on filtering companies\rquote  ability to: (1)
 harvest Web pages for review; (2) review and categorize the Web pages that they have harvested; and (3) engage in regular re-review of the Web pages that they have previously reviewed.  The primary limitations on filtering companies\rquote 
 ability to harvest We
b pages for review is that a substantial majority of pages on the Web are not indexable using the spidering technology that Web search engines use, and that together, search engines have indexed only around half of the Web pages that are theoretically ind
exable.  The fast rate of growth in the number of Web pages also limits filtering companies\rquote  ability to harvest pages for review.  These shortcomings necessarily result in significant underblocking.  
\par Several limitations on filtering companies\rquote  ability to review and categorize the Web pages that they have harvested also contribute to over- and underblocking.  First, automated review processes, even those based on \'93artificial intelligence,\'94
 are unable with any consistency to distinguish accurately material that falls within a category definition from material that does not.  Moreover, human review of URLs is hampered by filtering companies\rquote 
 limited staff sizes, and by human error or misjudgment.  In order to deal with the vast size of the Web and its rapid rat
es of growth and change, filtering companies engage in several practices that are necessary to reduce underblocking, but inevitably  result in overblocking.  These include: (1) blocking whole Web sites even when only a small minority of their pages contai
n material that would fit under one of the filtering company\rquote 
s categories (e.g., blocking the Salon.com site because it contains a sex column); (2) blocking by IP address (because a single IP address may contain many different Web sites and many thousands o
f pages of heterogenous content); and (3) blocking loophole sites such as translator sites and cache sites, which archive Web pages that have been removed from the Web by their original publisher.

 failure to e
ngage in regular re-review of Web pages that they have already categorized (or that they have determined do not fall into any category) results in a substantial amount of over- and underblocking.  For example, Web publishers change the contents of Web pag
es frequently.  The problem also arises when a Web site goes out of existence and its domain name or IP address is reassigned to a new Web site publisher.  In that case, a filtering company\rquote 
s previous categorization of the IP address or domain name would likely be incorrect, potentially resulting in the over- or underblocking of many thousands of pages.  
\par The inaccuracies that result from these limitations of filtering technology are quite substantial.  At least tens of thousands of pages of the indexable We
b are overblocked by each of the filtering programs evaluated by experts in this case, even when considered against the filtering companies\rquote 
 own category definitions.  Many erroneously blocked pages contain content that is completely innocuous for both adults and minors, and that no rational person could conclude matches the filtering companies\rquote  category definitions, such as \'93
pornography\'94 or \'93sex.\'94

The number of overblocked sites is of course much higher with respect to the definitions of obscenity and child pornography that CIPA employs for adults, since the filtering products\rquote  category definitions, such as \'93sex\'94 and \'93nudity,\'94
 encompass vast amounts
 of Web pages that are neither child pornography nor obscene.  Thus, the number of pages of constitutionally protected speech blocked by filtering products far exceeds the many thousands of pages that are overblocked by reference to the filtering products

First Amendment overbreadth doctrine creates a limited exception to this rule by permitting facial invalidation of a statute that burdens a substantial amount of protected speech, eve

 engaging in constitutionally protected speech that may nonetheless be proscribed by the law.  Without an overbreadth doctrine, \'93the contours of regulation would have to be hammered out case by case \endash

Plaintiffs argue that the overbreadth doctrine is applicable here, since CIPA \'93threatens to chill free speech \endash 
 because it will censor a substantial amount of protected speech, because it is vague, and because the law creates a prior restraint . . . .\'94

spending power, than in challenges to criminal statutes. 
\par Nonetheless, \'93even minor punishments can chill protected speech,\'94 }{\i\fs26 id.}{\fs26 , and absent the ability to challenge CIPA on its face, public libraries that depend on federal funds may decide to comply with CIPA\rquote

In this case, the patron plaintiffs are not asserting a First Amendment right to compel public libraries to acquire certain books
 or magazines for their print collections.  Nor are the Web site plaintiffs claiming a First Amendment right to compel public libraries to carry print materials that they publish.  Rather, the right at issue in this case is the specific right of library p

In particular, the government forcefully argues that a public library\rquote s decision to limit the content of its d
igital offerings on the Internet should be subject to no stricter scrutiny than its decisions about what content to make available to its patrons through the library\rquote

 access to speech is narrowly tailored to further a compelling state interest, so may a public library make content-based decisions about which

Although we agree with plaintiffs that the First Amendment imposes some limits on the state\rquote

\par We believe, however, that certain principles emerge from the Supreme Court\rquote 
s jurisprudence on this question.  In particular, and perhaps somewhat counterintuitively, the more narrow the range of speech that the government chooses to subsidize (whether directly, through government
 grants or other funding, or indirectly, through the creation of a public forum) the more deference the First Amendment accords the government in drawing content-based distinctions.

 growth, and rate of change of the Web, there is a tradeoff between underblocking and overblocking that is inherent in }{\i\fs26 any}{\fs26  filtering technology, as our findings of fact have demonstrated.  We credit the testimony of plaintiffs\rquote 
 expert witness, Dr. Geoffrey
 Nunberg, that no software exists that can automatically distinguish visual depictions that are obscene, child pornography, or harmful to minors, from those that are not.  Nor can software, through keyword analysis or more sophisticated techniques, consis
tently distinguish web pages that contain such content from web pages that do not.\tab

In light of the absence of any automated method of classifying Web pages, filtering companies are left with the Sisyphean task of using human review to identi
fy, from among the approximately two billion web pages that exist, the 1.5 million new pages that are created daily, and the many thousands of pages whose content changes from day to day, those particular web pages to be blocked.  To cope with the Web
\rquote s ex
traordinary size, rate of growth, and rate of change, filtering companies that rely solely on human review to block access to material falling within their category definitions must use a variety of techniques that will necessarily introduce substantial a
mounts of overblocking.  These techniques include blocking every page of a Web site that contains only some content falling within the filtering companies\rquote 
 category definitions, blocking every Web site that shares an IP-address with a Web site whose content falls within the category definitions, blocking \'93loophole sites,\'94
 such as anonymizers, cache sites, and translation sites, and allocating staff resources to reviewing content of uncategorized pages rather than re-reviewing pages, domain names, or IP-addre
sses that have been already categorized to determine whether their content has changed.  While a filtering company could choose not to use these techniques, due to the overblocking errors they introduce, if a filtering company does not use such techniques
, its filter will be ineffective at blocking access to speech that falls within its category definitions.
\par Thus, while it would be easy to design, for example, a filter that blocks only ten Web sites, all of which are either obscene, child pornography, or ha
rmful to minors, and therefore completely avoids overblocking, such a filter clearly would not comply with CIPA, since it would fail to offer any meaningful protection against the hundreds of thousands of Web sites containing speech in these categories.  
A
s detailed in our findings of fact, any filter that blocks enough speech to protect against access to visual depictions that are obscene, child pornography, and harmful to minors, will necessarily overblock substantial amounts of speech that does not fall
 within these categories.

We find that there are plausible, less restrictive alternatives to the use of software filters that would serve the government\rquote s interest in preventing the dissemination of obscenity and 
child pornography to library patrons.  In particular, public libraries can adopt Internet use policies that make clear to patrons that the library\rquote 
s Internet terminals may not be used to access illegal content.  Libraries can ensure that their patrons are 
aware of such policies by posting them in prominent places in the library, requiring patrons to sign forms agreeing to comply with the policy before the library issues library cards to patrons, and by presenting patrons, when they log on to one of the lib
rary\rquote s Internet terminals, with a screen that requires the user to agree to comply with the library\rquote s policy before allowing the user access to the Internet.
\par Libraries can detect violations of their Internet use policies either through direct observation or through review of the library\rquote 
s Internet use logs.  In some cases, library staff or patrons may directly observe a patron accessing obscenity and child pornography.  Libraries\rquote  Internet use logs, however, also provide libraries with a means of detecting v
iolations of their Internet use policies.  These logs, which can be kept regardless whether a library uses filtering software, record the URL of every Web page accessed by patrons.  Although ordinarily the logs do not link particular URLs with particular 
p
atrons, it is possible, using access logs, to identify the patron who viewed the Web page corresponding to a particular URL, if library staff discover in the access logs the URL of a Web page containing obscenity or child pornography.  For example, David 
Biek, Director of Tacoma Public Library\rquote 
s main branch, testified that in the course of scanning Internet use logs he has found what looked like attempts to access child pornography, notwithstanding the fact that Tacoma uses Websense filtering software.  In 
two cases, he communicated his findings to law enforcement and turned over the logs to law enforcement in response to a subpoena.}{\cs15\fs26\super \chftn {\footnote \pard\plain \ql \li0\ri0\sa240\nowidctlpar\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0

We acknowledge that some library staff will be uncomfortable using the \'93tap-on-the-shoulder\'94 method of enforcing the library\rquote

 resort to a tap-on-the-shoulder method of enforcement, where library staff observes a patron openly violating the library\rquote

\par We also acknowledge that use of a tap on the shoulder delegates to librarians substantial discretion to determine which Web sites a patron may view.  Nonetheless, we do not believe that this putative \'93prior restraint\'94

Similar less restrictive alternatives exist for preventing minors from accessing material harmful to minors.  First, libraries may use the tap-on-the-shoulder method when minors are observed using the

Alternatively, libraries can use privacy screens or recessed monitors to prevent patrons from unwillingly being exposed to material viewed by other patrons.  We acknowledge that privacy screens and recessed m

th patrons attempting to remove the privacy screens.  Privacy screens and recessed monitors also make it difficult for more than one person to work at the same terminal.
\par These problems, however, are not insurmountable.  While there is no doubt that privacy
 screens and recessed terminals impose additional costs on libraries, the government has failed to show that the cost of privacy screens or recessed terminals is substantially greater than the cost of filtering software and the resources needed to maintai

Fort Vancouver Regional Library and the Multnomah County Public Library, that it is possible for public libraries to prevent patrons from removing the screens.  Although privacy screens may make it difficult for patrons to work at the same terminal side b
y side with other patrons or with library staff, a library could provide filtered access at terminals that lack privacy screens, when patrons wish to use a terminal with others.  Alternatively, a library can reserve terminals outside of patrons\rquote

to enable access to all constitutionally protected material.\'94
  As a textual matter, this reading of the disabling provisions is plausible.  If a patron seeks access to speech that is constitutionally protected, then it is reasonable to conclude that the patron has a \'93lawful purpose,\'94 since the di

At bottom, however, we need not definitively construe CIPA\rquote s disabling provisions, since it suffices in this case to assume without deciding that the disabling provisions permit libraries to allow a patron access to any sp

\par To be sure, the government demonstrated that it is poss

library will subsequently unblock.  Although a public library\rquote 
s ability to permit anonymous unblocking requests addresses the deterrent effect of requiring patrons to identify themselves before gaining access to a particular Web site, we believe that it fails adequately to address the overblocking problem.

In particular, even allowing anonymous requests for unblocking burdens patrons\rquote  access to speech, since such requests cannot immediately be acted on.  Although the Tacoma Public Library, for
 example, attempts to review requests for unblocking within 24 hours, requests sometimes are not reviewed for several days.  And delays are inevitable in libraries with branches that lack the staff necessary immediately to review patron unblocking request
s.  Because many Internet users \'93surf\'94
 the Web, visiting hundreds of Web sites in a single session and spending only a short period of time viewing many of the sites, the requirement that a patron take the time to affirmatively request access to a blocked W

The burden of requiring library patrons to ask permission to view Web sites whose content is disfavored resembles the burden that the Supreme Court found unacceptable in }{\i\fs26 Denver}{\fs26

Fabulous Associates}{\fs26 , the Third Circuit explained that a law preventing adults from listening to sexually explicit phone messages unless they applied in advance for access to such messages would burden adults\rquote 
 receipt of constitutionally protected speech, given consumers\rquote  tendency to purchase such speech on impulse.  }{\i\fs26 See}{\fs26  }{\i\fs26 Fabulous Assocs.}{\fs26

\par In sum, in many cases, as we have noted above, library patrons who have been wrongly denied access to a Web site will decline to ask the library to disable the filters so that the patron can access the Web site. \~
Moreover, even if patrons requested unblocking every time a site is erroneously blocked, and even if library staff granted every such request, a public library\rquote s use of blocking software would still impermissibly burden patrons\rquote 
 access to speech based on its content. \~The First Amendment jurisprudence of the Supreme Court and the Third Circuit makes clear that laws imposing content-based burdens on access to speech are no less offensive to the First 
Amendment than laws imposing content-based prohibitions on speech:

It is of no moment that the statute does not impose a complete prohibition.  The distinction between laws burdening and laws banning speech is but a matter of degree.  The Government\rquote s cont
ent-based burdens must satisfy the same rigorous scrutiny as its content-based bans. . . .  When the purpose and design of a statute is to regulate speech by reason of its content, special consideration or latitude is not afforded to the Government merely
 because the law can somehow be described as a burden rather than outright suppression.

\fs24\lang1033\langfe1033\cgrid\langnp1033\langfenp1033 {\fs26 Based upon the foregoing discussion, we hold that a public library\rquote s content-based restriction on patrons\rquote 
 access to speech on the Internet is subject to strict scrutiny.  Every item in a library\rquote s print coll
ection has been selected because library staff, or a party to whom staff delegates the decision, deems the content to be particularly valuable.  In contrast, the Internet, as a forum, is open to any member of the public to speak, and hence, even when a li
brary provides filtered Internet access,\~
it creates a public forum in which the vast majority of the speech has been reviewed by neither librarians nor filtering companies.  Under public forum doctrine, where the state creates such a forum open to any membe
r of the public to speak on an unlimited number of subjects, the state\rquote 
s decision selectively to exclude certain speech on the basis of its content, is subject to strict scrutiny, since such exclusions risk distorting the marketplace of ideas that the state has created.
\par Application of strict scrutiny to public libraries\rquote  content-based restrictions on their patrons\rquote  access to the Internet finds further support in the analogy to traditional public fora, such as sidewalks, parks, and squares, in which content-
based restrictions on speech are always subject to strict scrutiny.  Like these traditional public fora, Internet access in public libraries uniquely promotes First Amendment values, by offering low barriers to entry to speakers and listeners.  The conten
t of speech on the Internet is as diverse as human thought, and the extent to which the Internet promotes First Amendment values is evident from the sheer breadth of speech that this new medium enables.  
\par To survive strict scrutiny, a public library\rquote s use o
f filtering software must be narrowly tailored to further a compelling state interest, and there must be no less restrictive alternative that could effectively further that interest.  We find that, given the crudeness of filtering technology, any technolo
gy protection measure mandated by CIPA will necessarily block access to a substantial amount of speech whose suppression serves no legitimate government interest.  This lack of narrow tailoring cannot be cured by CIPA\rquote 
s disabling provisions, because patrons will often be deterred from asking the library\rquote s permission to access an erroneously blocked Web page, and anonymous requests for unblocking cannot be acted on without delaying the patron\rquote 
s access to the blocked Web page, thereby impermissibly burdening access to speech on the basis of its content.

Moreover, less restrictive alternatives exist to further a public library\rquote s legitimate interests in preventing its computers from being used to access obscenity, child pornography, or in the case
 of minors, material harmful to minors, and in preventing patrons from being unwillingly exposed to patently offensive, sexually explicit speech.  Libraries may use a variety of means to monitor their patrons\rquote 
 use of the Internet and impose sanctions on patrons who violate the library\rquote 
s Internet use policy.  To protect minors from material harmful to minors, libraries could grant minors unfiltered access only if accompanied by a parent, or upon parental consent, or could require minors to use unfiltered ter
minals in view of library staff.  To prevent patrons from being unwillingly exposed to offensive, sexually explicit content, libraries can offer patrons the option of using blocking software, can place unfiltered terminals outside of patrons\rquote 
 sight lines, 
and can use privacy screens and recessed monitors.  While none of these less restrictive alternatives are perfect, the government has failed to show that they are significantly less effective than filtering software, which itself fails to block access to 
large amounts of speech that fall within the categories sought to be blocked.

In view of the severe limitations of filtering technology and the existence of these less restrictive alternatives, we conclude that it is not possible for a public
 library to comply with CIPA without blocking a very substantial amount of constitutionally protected speech, in violation of the First Amendment.  Because this conclusion derives from the inherent limits of the filtering technology mandated by CIPA, it h
olds for any library that complies with CIPA\rquote s conditions.  Hence, even under the stricter standard of facial invalidity proposed by the government, which would require us to uphold CIPA if only a single library can comply with CIPA\rquote 
s conditions without vio
lating the First Amendment, we conclude that CIPA is facially invalid, since it will induce public libraries, as state actors, to violate the First Amendment.  Because we hold that CIPA is invalid on these grounds, we need not reach the plaintiffs\rquote 
 alterna
tive theories that CIPA is invalid as a prior restraint on speech and is unconstitutionally vague.  Nor need we decide whether CIPA is invalid because it requires public libraries, as a condition on the receipt of federal funds, to relinquish their own Fi

ition on their receipt of federal funds, to surrender their First Amendment right to provide the public with access to constitutionally protected speech.  Under this theory, even if it does not violate the First Amendment for a public library to use filte
ring software, it nonetheless violates the First Amendment for the federal government to require public libraries to use filters as a condition of the receipt of federal funds.  
\par The government contends that this case does not fall under the unconstitutiona
l conditions framework because: (1) as state actors, the recipients of the funds (the public libraries) are not protected by the First Amendment, and therefore are not being asked to relinquish any constitutionally protected rights; and (2) although libra
ry patrons are undoubtedly protected by the First Amendment, they are not the funding recipients in this case, and libraries may not rely on their patrons\rquote  rights in order to state an unconstitutional conditions claim.
\par It is an open question in this Circuit
 whether Congress may violate the First Amendment by restricting the speech of public entities, such as municipalities or public libraries.  The only U.S. Supreme Court opinion to weigh in on the issue is a concurrence by Justice Stewart, joined by Chief 
Justice Burger and Justice Rehnquist, in which he opined that municipalities and other arms of the state are not protected by the First Amendment from governmental interference with their expression.  }{\i\fs26 
See Colum. Broad. Sys., Inc. v. Democratic Nat\rquote l Comm.}{\fs26 , 412 U.S. 94, 139 (1973) (Stewart, J., concurring) (\'93The First Amendment protects the press }{\i\fs26 from}{\fs26  governmental interference; it confers no analogous protection }{

rivate expression and nothing in the guarantee precludes the government from controlling its own expression or that of its agents.\'94) (quoting Thomas Emerson, }{\i\fs26 The System of Freedom of Expression}{\fs26 
 700 (1970) (internal quotation marks omitted)).  The Court has
 subsequently made it clear, however, that it considers it to be an open question whether municipalities acting in their capacity as employers have First Amendment rights, suggesting that the question whether public entities are ever protected by the Firs
t Amendment also remains open.  }{\i\fs26 See City of Madison Joint Sch. Dist. No. 8 v. Wisc. Employment Relations Comm\rquote n}{\fs26 , 429 U.S. 167, 175 n.7 (1976) (\'93
We need not decide whether a municipal corporation as an employer has First Amendment rights to hear the views of its citizens and employees.\'94).
\par Several courts of appeals have cited Justice Stewart\rquote s concurrence in }{\i\fs26 Columbia Broadcasting Systems}{\fs26  and have, with little discussion or analysis, concluded that a \'93government . . . speaker is not itself protected by the firs
t amendment.\'94  }{\i\fs26 Warner Cable Communications, Inc. v. City of Niceville}{\fs26 , 911 F.2d 634, 638 (11th Cir. 1990); }{\i\fs26 see also NAACP v. Hunt}{\fs26 , 891 F.2d 1555, 1565 (11th Cir. 1990) (\'93[T]he First Amendment protects citizens

, 863 F.2d 371, 379 (5th Cir. 1989) (noting that \'93the first amendment does not protect government speech\'94).  
\par We do not think that the question whether public librar
ies are protected by the First Amendment can be resolved as simply as these cases suggest.  This difficulty is demonstrated by the reasoning of the Seventh Circuit in a case in which that court considered whether municipalities are protected by the First 
Amendment and noted that it is an open question that could plausibly be answered in the affirmative, yet declined to decide it:

s requirement that public libraries use such software is in effect a requirement that public libraries block a substantial amount of constitutionally protected speech on the basis of its content. 
\par Plaintiffs\rquote  argument that the federal government may not require public libraries who receive federal funds to restrict the availability of constitutionally protected Web sites solely on the basis of the sites\rquote 
 content finds further support in the role that public libraries have traditionally served in maintaining First Amendment values.  As evidenced by the many public libraries that have endorsed the Freedom to Read Statement and the Library Bill of Rights, }
{\i\fs26 see supra}{\fs26 
 Subsection II.D.1, public libraries seemingly have a duty to challenge prevailing orthodoxy and make available to the public controversial, yet constitutionally protected material, even if it means drawing the ire of the community.  }{\i\fs26 See}{\fs26

\par By interfering with public libraries\rquote  discretion to make available to patrons as wide a range of constitutionally protected s
peech as possible, the federal government is arguably distorting the usual functioning of public libraries as places of freewheeling inquiry.  The }{\i\fs26 Velazquez}{\fs26  Court, in invalidating the federal government\rquote 
s restrictions on the ability of federally funded legal services providers to challenge the constitutionality of welfare laws, relied on the manner in which the restrictions that the federal government placed on legal services\rquote  attorneys\rquote 
 speech distorted the usual functioning of the judicial system:

d otherwise provide to patrons; and (2) delegate decision making to private software developers who closely guard their selection criteria as trade secrets and who do not purport to make their decisions on the basis of whether the blocked Web sites are co

\par In sum, we think that the plaintiffs have good arguments that they may assert an unconstitutional conditions claim by relying either on the public libraries\rquote  First Amendment rights or on the rights of their patrons.  We a
lso think that the plaintiffs have a good argument that CIPA\rquote 
s requirement that public libraries use filtering software distorts the usual functioning of public libraries in such a way that it constitutes an unconstitutional condition on the receipt of fun

 Sections II.D-E, would allow the Supreme Court to decide the unconstitutional conditions claim if the Court deems it necessary.

olates the First Amendment, we would usually be required to determine whether CIPA is severable from the remainder of the statutes governing LSTA and E-rate funding.  Neither party, however, has advanced the argument that CIPA is not severable from the re
mainder the Library Services and Technology Act and Communications Act of 1934 (the two statutes governing LSTA and E-rate funding, respectively), and at all events, we think that CIPA is severable.
\par \'93The inquiry into whether a statute is severable is essentially an inquiry into legislative intent.\'94  }{\i\fs26 Minn. v. Mille Lacs Band of Chippewa Indians}{\fs26 , 526 U.S. 172, 191 (1999).  }{\b\f29\fs26 \'93Unless }{\fs26

, 424 U.S. 1, 108 (1976) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  There is no doubt that if we were to strike CIPA from the sections of the Unit
ed States Code where it is currently codified, the remaining statutory sections, providing eligible public libraries with E-rate discounts and LSTA grants, would be fully operative as law.  Indeed, the LSTA and E-rate programs existed prior to the enactme
nt of CIPA in substantially the same form as they would exist were we to strike CIPA and leave the rest of the programs intact.

The second question, whether Congress would in this case have chosen to repeal the LSTA and E-rate subsidy programs instead of continuing to fund them if it had known that CIPA\rquote 
s limitations on these programs were constitutionally invalid, is less clear.  CIPA contains \'93separability\'94 clauses that state that if any of its additions to the statutes governing the LSTA an
d E-rate programs are found to be unconstitutional, Congress intended to effectuate as much of CIPA\rquote s amendments as possible.}{\cs15\fs26\super \chftn {\footnote \pard\plain \ql \li0\ri0\sa240\nowidctlpar\faauto\rin0\lin0\itap0

 9134(f)(6), and provides: \'93If any provision of this subsection is held invalid, the remainder of this subsection shall not be affected thereby.\'94  CIPA section 1721(e) also contained a similar provision that applied to E-rate funding, although 
it was not codified in the Communications Act.  That section, also titled \'93Separability,\'94 provided: \'93
If any provision of paragraph (5) or (6) of section 254(h) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended by this section, or the application thereof to any
 person or circumstance is held invalid, the remainder of such paragraph and the application of such paragraph to other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.\'94  CIPA \'a7 1721(e).  }}}{\fs26 
  We interpret these clauses to mean, for example, that if a court were to find that CIPA\rquote 
s requirements are unconstitutional with respect to adult patrons, but permissible with respect to minors, that Congress intended to have the court effectuate only the provisions with respect to minors.  These separability cla
uses do not speak to the situation before us, however, where we have found that CIPA is facially unconstitutional in its entirety.

Nevertheless, the government has not pointed to anything in the legislative history or elsewhere to suggest that Congress intended to discontinue funding under the LSTA and E-rate programs unless it could effectuate CIPA\rquote 
s restrictions on the funding.  And Congress\rquote s decision, prior to CIPA\rquote s enactment, to subsidize Internet access through the LSTA and E-rate pr
ograms without such restrictions, counsels that we reach the opposite conclusion.  At bottom, we think that it is unclear what Congress\rquote 
s intent was on this point, and in the absence of such information, we exercise a presumption in favor of severability.  }{\i\fs26 Regan v. Time, Inc.}{\fs26 , 468 U.S. 641, 653 (1984) (\'93[T]he presumption is in favor of severability.\'94); }{\i\fs26

 of uncertainty whether Congress intended to fund the Legal Services Corporation even if a restriction on the funding was to be declared invalid).
\par For the foregoing reasons, we will enter a final judgment declaring Sections 1712(a)(2) and 1721(b) of the Children\rquote s Internet Protection Act, codified at 20 U.S.C. \'a7 9134(f) and 47 U.S.C. \'a7
 254(h)(6), respectively, to be facially invalid under the First Amendment and permanently enjoining the defendants from enforcing those provisions.

\par 
\par \hich\af2\dbch\af23\loch\f2 We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
\par \hich\af2\dbch\af23\loch\f2 time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
\par \hich\af2\dbch\af23\loch\f2 to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
\par \hich\af2\dbch\af23\loch\f2 searched and analyzed, the c\hich\af2\dbch\af23\loch\f2 opyright letters written, etc.   Our
\par \hich\af2\dbch\af23\loch\f2 projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
\par \hich\af2\dbch\af23\loch\f2 per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
\par \hich\af2\dbch\af23\loch\f2 million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
\par \hich\af2\dbch\af23\loch\f2 files per month:  12\hich\af2\dbch\af23\loch\f2 40 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
\par \hich\af2\dbch\af23\loch\f2 We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
\par \hich\af2\dbch\af23\loch\f2 If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
\par \hich\af2\dbch\af23\loch\f2 will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.
\par 
\par \hich\af2\dbch\af23\loch\f2 The Goal of\hich\af2\dbch\af23\loch\f2  Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
