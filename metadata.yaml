description: This is an important ruling for Project Gutenberg, in that it removes
  the necessity for US libraries to run filtering software as had been ordered by
  the CIPA legislation.  PG doesn't usually distribute legislation and rulings, but
  in this case it seemed worthwhile.  At 195 pages, the ruling is an extensive and
  informed look at Internet use and censorship.
